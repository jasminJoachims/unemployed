This project was started to process big excel files in order to avoid multiple manual copy/paste operations. The workflow consists of two steps:

1. scrape the necessary files from the website https://statistik.arbeitsagentur.de/SiteGlobals/Forms/Suche/Einzelheftsuche_Formular.html?submit=Suchen&topic_f=gemeinde-arbeitslose-quoten
2. process the data in the file sheets, slice, transpose and copy to a new excel file
